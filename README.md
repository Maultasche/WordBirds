# WordBirds
The source code for a demo website for a word game that came out of Startup Weekend Sacramento.

The concept of WordBirds is to create mobile application containing a word game that can be played in a group. The gameplay revolves around a pair of clues: an adjective and a verb. You have to guess a synonym for each clue, and both the clues need to rhyme.

For example:
- obese | feline = fat cat
- sneaker | adhesive = shoe glue

There was no time to create a nice mobile application in the time Startup Weekend provided, so we created a simple website at www.wordbirds.co in the span of a few hours to give people some examples of gameplay and measure interest in the game.

This website was created using [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/). The data that was inserted into the MongoDB database can be found in the data.json file.
